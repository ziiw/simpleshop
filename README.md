Simple shop
===================


Welcome to this Simple shop, glad you are here ! The aim of this project is to create a deadly simple shop to start a new e-commerce. 
This boilerplate should be able to handle the most simple project, and also be able to scale for bigger projects. Let's take a look of what's inside 🤓
