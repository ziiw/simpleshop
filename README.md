Fjord Prototype Boilerplate
===================


Welcome to this prototype boilerplate, glad you are here ! The aim of this project is to create a deadly simple boilerplate to start a new project. 
This boilerplate should be able to handle the most simple project, and also be able to scale for bigger projects. Let's take a look of what's inside 🤓

----------

### 1. Install ⏳
Grab all the packages you need to run this project.
```
npm i
```

### 2. Development  🔨
```
npm start
```
It will start the `webpack-dev-server` who's taking care of all the changes you made to your files and reload your browser 👌

### 3. Build 📦
When you want to deploy, just run:
```
npm run build
```

### 4. Deploy 🚀
Now you are able to grab `/dist` and deploy it wherever you want !
